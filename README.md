School Bus Mate is a tool to assist bus drivers and students by giving them the
latest seat arrangements, bus routes, reports, announcements, and more. We use
Python with Kivy to make this app. We want to have a polished design that is
easy to use. The app is expected to release around May 2022 on Google Play for
students and on Windows for drivers and administrators. An iOS version will
be released in the future as well.

## Future Features
Here is a brief list of features we wish to implement:
* Parents' app (can track bus)
* Profiles (Students and Teacher)

## Install and Run
This app is easy to install for now. All you have to do is install the GitHub
project files and install `requirements.txt` included in the files. After that,
just run `main.py`.

## How to Use
To use School Bus Mate, open `main.py` and run it. The login screen will popup.
For now there are no passwords, so enter anything. Either login or signup. If
you are signing up, the drivers and admins are not functional yet, so be a
student. You will then see the main screen. This screen is still a work in
progress, so you can play around with it. If the app doesn't function or run,
please refer to the `Problems` section below.

## Problems
If there are any problems running or using the app, please create a new issue
in the GitHub project page. Our team will help you ASAP.

 already be more app ideas in the works...
