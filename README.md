School Bus Mate was a tool to assist bus drivers and students by giving them the
latest seat arrangements, bus routes, reports, announcements, and more. We used
Python with Kivy to make this app. We wanted to have a polished design that is
easy to use. The app was expected to release around May 2023 on Google Play for
students and on Windows for drivers and administrators.

## The End
School Bus Mate was ended in 2022 due to lack of funding. The project started
getting expensive when servers and software were needed for the development of
the app. The head developer @Zer0-Official said, "I promise, at some point in
time, I will reboot and finish this project." The director replied, "Don't make
that promise." jokingly.

## Future Features
Here is a brief list of features we wished to implement:
* Parents' app (can track bus)
* Profiles (Students and Teacher)

## How to Use
This project was cancelled in 2022 and is not working.
